# photons
concepts for accumulating individual photon events

At low photon counts, photons through an aperture do not accumulate into the expected Airy pattern.
Instead, they accumulate into seeminly random patterns that only begin to appear as Airy patterns
after thousands of photons are captured.

The "photons.py" script generates accumulated images, one for each new photon.
The resulting photons.255.230.gif is an animated images of the sequence.
